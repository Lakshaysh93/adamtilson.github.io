<p>ENSE 271 - People-Centred Design - Laboratory</p>

      <p>In the previous lab we looked at using Figma to make high fidelity wireframes. However, these were only static sites with no interactivity. We will now look at using the Figma Prototyping workflow to add some interactivity to our website mockups, which we can demonstrate using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Present</code> function.</p>

      <p>Download the starting files from URCourses, and open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">travel-hyrule-starting.fig</code>, a mobile tourism site for a fictional land.</p>

      <p>We will work together through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting a home page and previewing</li>
        <li>Connecting the hamburger menu to each of the pages</li>
        <li>Connecting the Weird Stuff page to their subpages</li>
        <li>Add an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">automatic carousel</code> to the first page</li>
        <li>Add some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">light boxes</code> to the locations page</li>
        <li>Have a unique interaction on each of the strange
          <ul>
            <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slow auto-fade effect</code> on the shrines page</li>
            <li>A draggable gallery on the divine beasts page, with a subtle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cover flow</code> effect</li>
            <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">carousel with buttons</code> on the towers page</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note, as this was adapted from XD, I am still using their terminology <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Artboard</code> in places, but in Figma this is called a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Frame</code>.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="prototypinghomepageandpreviewing"><button class="collapsible">Prototyping, Home Page and Previewing</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>To add interactivity to our design, we need to be in prototyping mode. Switch to prototyping mode using the top menu:</p>

      <p><img src="res/1-prototype.png" alt="Prototype mode" /></p>

      <p>A journey through our prototype is called a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flow</code>. We need to set a default flow starting point, so that when we start our presentation Figma knows which screen to start on. The home screen may already be set as the default flow starting point.</p>

      <p><img src="res/2-home.png" alt="Starting flow" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/flow-working.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>You can configure your present mode to simulate an android phone using the following settings</p>

      <p><img src="res/configure-present-for-android-1.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/configure-present-for-android-2.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>You can preview your page by clicking on the preview icon.</p>

      <p><img src="res/3-preview.png" alt="Preview" /></p>

      <p><img src="res/4-preview-1.png" alt="Preview" /></p>

      <p>This will open up your view. You can scroll around and click on things, but not much will happen yet. Let’s try to fix that.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="wiringupthehomemenu"><button class="collapsible">Wiring up the home menu</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>In prototyping, we can connect a visual element, called a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hotspot</code> to respond to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trigger</code> (e.g. tapping, dragging) to cause a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transition</code> to another page. This process is called adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connection</code>, and requires a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destination</code>. In addition, we can also cause pages to temporarily <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overlay</code> the current page.</p>

      <p>First we will connect each of the pages to the menu via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hamburger menu</code> icon.</p>

      <p>Click this icon on the Home page. A new circle gizmo will appear on the right side of the icon. Hover over it and click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and drag it to the menu screen to the left.</p>

      <p><img src="res/5-our-first-wire.png" alt="Our first wire" /></p>

      <p>You will see that it is wired correctly if a curved blue line connects the screens.</p>

      <p><img src="res/7-wired.png" alt="All wired up" /></p>

      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transitions</code> can also have animation. Let’s cause our menu to slide down. Access the interaction settings in the menu from here:</p>

      <p><img src="res/6-animation-settings.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>It is a good idea to preview here to be sure we are happy with our settings. We are going to want to copy this transition to each of our hamburger menus on each of our pages.</p>

      <p>To copy a setting you need to click on the left gutter beside the interaction (This is a small window, maybe ten pixels):</p>

      <p><img src="res/select-an-interaction.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>You will know you have the interaction selected because it is highlighted in blue:</p>

      <p><img src="res/interaction-highlighted.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Copy it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+c</code>.</p>

      <p>Now click on the hamburger on the next page, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+v</code>. You should see the same animation appear in the interactions pane.</p>

      <p><img src="res/copy-paste-interaction.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Continue for all hamburger menus.</p>

      <p>You also need to wire up the hamburger menu of links back to the appropriate pages. Let’s start with the home page.</p>

      <p><img src="res/9-wired-back-up.png" alt="Wired back up" /></p>

      <p>Once you have configured the interactions as you like, these remain the default for further connections from this page.</p>

      <p>And then set the other pages too:</p>

      <p><img src="res/10-hamburger-menu-complete.png" alt="Hamburger complete" /></p>

      <p>The wires are getting pretty crazy. Don’t worry, it will get much, much worse.</p>

      <p>Run your preview again, and confirm that all of the links are working correctly.</p>

      <p>This is the complete workflow to link pages together. In the next sections we will work on animations to bring the pages to life.</p>

      <p>While we’re linking pages, notice that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weird Stuff</code> page should link to three sub pages. Link with the following animation settings:</p>

      <p><img src="res/10.1-weird-stuff.png" alt="Weird stuff lints" /></p>

      <p>This will create a push effect. We don’t typically see this on the web, but they may be used in a mobile app.</p>

      <p>Repeat for the other two pages.</p>

      <p>Each of these pages has a back button, which we can wire back to the weird stuff page. However, we can simply set the interaction style to back, which will return to the previous page, and attempt to reverse the interaction as well! (Though I sometimes encountered bugs with it):</p>

      <p><img src="res/10.2-back.png" alt="Back" /></p>

      <p>Alternatively, you could hard code the destination, and just be sure the mirror the direction of the “push”.</p>

      <p><img src="res/push-back.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>This may also be a fun time to try the different easings, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bouncy</code></p>

      <p><img src="res/bouncy.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Ensure all pages are linked, and test it out, does it go forward and backward as expected? You can try different animations for the three pages, forward and back, to see what you like.</p>

      <p><img src="res/10.3-sub-pages-all-wired-with-back.png" alt="sub pages wired" /></p>

      <p>This is all we need to get basic interactivity. However, in the next sections we are going to look at some advanced animations for giving our prototypes some extra polish.</p>

      <p>In preparation for this, we want to reorganize our board, so that each of the main pages are aligned vertically, with space to their right which we will use for progressive animation frames. You can do this by box selecting from prototype and dragging full frames around:</p>

      <p><img src="res/pages-stacked.png" alt="" /></p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="automaticcarousel"><button class="collapsible">Automatic carousel </button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>On the top of the home page, in the image bar, I have placed three images offset slightly to the left. We want to make an animation which automatically transitions through these three images at regular intervals.</p>

      <p>To create animations, we need to create a few keyframes. Our animations will be automatically animated between keyframes using interpolation, in a process known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inbetweening</code>, or simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tweening</code>. Each keyframe is a complete copy of an artboard, with only one or two small adjustments between keyframes. While still in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Prototype</code>, drag the home page down into some open space so it easier to work with. Next make two copies of the home page, using ctrl+d. If you make these copies in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Prototype</code>, existing links will be copied too, which will save us some time. Delete and reposition the images in the top bar so that one and only one unique image exists in the same place in each of the three artboards:</p>

      <p><img src="res/11-keyframes.png" alt="Keyframes" /></p>

      <p>Connect the first artboard to the second with the following settings:</p>

      <p>![Carousel transition](
<img src="res/12-carousel-transition.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Wire up the second to the third screen, and the third screen back to the first. Unfortunately you will update the settings on each page. Alternatively, you can copy and paste, as we saw earlier, and move the destination.</p>

      <p><img src="res/13-tangled-up.png" alt="Tangled up" /></p>

      <p>Preview the page. The image should swap automatically every few seconds. Note that if you scroll when a transition is occurring, weird things will happen. This seems to be due to a conflict in two animations playing at once. So far I don’t know a good workaround.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="lightboxesforthelocationpage"><button class="collapsible">Lightboxes for the location page</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>Next let’s add some Lightboxes to the location page. Lightboxes dim the screen and show some content highlighted in a popup. We will allow the user to click on the text at various points in the page, and have a pop-up appear with more information.</p>

      <p>Move the location page near the four lightboxes, and wire the links together with the following settings:</p>

      <p><img src="res/22-lightboxes.png" alt="light boxes" /></p>

      <p>We can also wire the close buttons back to close the overlay.</p>

      <p><img src="res/lightbox-close.png" alt="" /></p>

      <p>Test it out. You may click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> to close the lightbox. The dimming effect is caused by a slightly transparent dark filled rectangle placed under the info box in the lightbox, although it looks like there is a native ability to do this in Figma, but I did not explore it.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="autofadeanimationonshrinepage"><button class="collapsible">Auto-fade Animation on Shrine page</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>In this section we’ll make a slow transition on the shrine page. Duplicate the shrine page, and center one of the two shrine images in each page. Finally, add transition effects back and forth with the following settings. (no delay, slow animate)</p>

      <p><img src="res/14-shrine-fade.png" alt="Shrine Fade" /></p>

      <p>Preview the page. This effect looks pretty neat. However, notice that page scrolling is strange. This is because the scroll animation is playing over the old fade out, which does not scroll with it. For this reason, these types of animations should be used cautiously, for example, on splash screen pages and single-page views without scroll.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="draggablegallerypagewithzoomingeffect"><button class="collapsible">Draggable Gallery Page with Zooming Effect</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>On the Divine Beasts page we will simulate a draggable scrolling gallery effect. In addition, the image which is currently in view will be enlarged somewhat, to make an effect similar to Coverflow.</p>

      <p>For this effect we will need six total keyframes, but we will make four to start.</p>

      <p>Duplicate the page, and move the image slider so that one of the four images is in the middle of the frame, in order from left to right. Be careful not to drag the group out of the frame when sliding them over!:</p>

      <p><img src="res/15-divine-beasts-first-four-keyframes.png" alt="First four keyframes" /></p>

      <p>To make this effect even more interesting, we will zoom in on the selected beast in each frame. Double-click on the group, select the image in frame, and scale it up. If you hold <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shift</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> while you drag, it will stay centered and scale while maintaining the aspect ratio.</p>

      <p><img src="res/16-divine-beasts-zoomed.png" alt="Divine Beasts Zoomed" /></p>

      <p>We need two more keyframes to complete this animation. Duplicated the third artboard as the fifth, and the second artboard as the sixth.</p>

      <p><img src="res/17-all-keyframes.png" alt="Divine Beasts Zoomed" /></p>

      <p>Now we’ll add our animations. The easiest way is to add one animation first, adjust the settings, and then copy and paste more.</p>

      <p><img src="res/18-drag.png" alt="Drag" /></p>

      <p>It may be tricky to find the connector on the banner, look to the right side of it, which will be different in each of the images, due to the positioning.</p>

      <p>Once you have the animation settings correct, connect each images to their keyframe to their right, and connect the final image back to the first artboard.</p>

      <p>Test the page. Drag through your images all the way to the right, and then all the way back to the left. The limitation to this animation is that you can only drag in this specific order, but it still creates a neat animation with the coverflow zooming effect.</p>

      <p>The trick to making this work was using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart animate</code> feature, which tweens between differences properties in adjacent frames, including scaling, position, and more. Play with this feature to see what you can come up with!</p>

      <p>Also note how dragging changes the behaviour of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">back</code> button - it now undoes the last animation rather than going to the previous page. If you do not like this functionality, you can instead hard wire the back buttons back to the Weird Stuff page with the push right effect.</p>

    </div></div></section>
<section id="fiveimagecarouselwitharrowsandprogressbuttons"><button class="collapsible">Five image carousel with arrows and progress buttons</button><div class="text-content"><div class="text-inner">

      <p>The final “Weird Stuff” page will have a five image carousel.</p>

      <p>As always, drag it down somewhere you can work, and duplicate it into five keyframes. Have a different image from the set of five images in each keyframe. Also, change the fill on the little circles so that they match up with their keyframe.</p>

      <p><img src="res/19-slides.png" alt="Slides" /></p>

      <p>Wiring this pattern is very logical. You simply need to wire up the triangles to the next or previous artboard (and don’t forget to wrap around from the last to the first, and vice versa.) Don’t forget to set the animation style after drawing the first wire! Also wire up the circles to the corresponding image. These settings work well:</p>

      <p><img src="res/20-wiring.png" alt="Wiring" /></p>

      <p>Each page should have six exists (two arrows and four circles) to make the gallery work. When it’s all wired up, it will be quite a mess!</p>

      <p><img src="res/21-rats-nest.png" alt="rat's nest" /></p>

      <p>Test it out. The arrows are easy test, the bubbles slightly less so, as you would need to test all four exists from each page! I test first page to the remaining four and back, second page to the remaining three and back, third page to the remaining two and back, etc.</p>

      <p>And that’s it. The full website is accessible, with several interesting effects. Test it out to see if anything is broken. Are all the hamburger icons leading to the menu page? You can verify by clicking on the menu and tracing all of the dashed lines.</p>

      <p>Your project for this lab is to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual museum</code>, a prototype of a simple webpage which simulates touring a real-world museum (or similar place, like Aquarium, Zoo or Hall of Fame) in Figma. Your tour should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A home page</li>
        <li>Some type of menu (properly connected so that every page is accessible)</li>
        <li>Three exhibits, with a page for each
          <ul>
            <li>Each exhibit should have a name, a set of images and text description</li>
            <li>The images should be stored in some type of interactive image container
              <ul>
                <li>You can use ones from the pre-lab, or create your own</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use a different type of interaction for each page</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please include some images from the exhibits. Many museums license their images in the creative commons, but even if not, it is okay to use them in this project as it is for educational / non-commercial purposes.</p>

      <p>As we are now at the half way point of the lab, do not forget about your running assignment of maintaining a github portfolio! This would be a good time to ensure everything is up to date, well organized, and easy to navigate. Think about users browsing your page as a portfolio, are they likely to download and open up “.fig” files, or would they rather see screen capture images presented in easily to see markdown files?</p>
